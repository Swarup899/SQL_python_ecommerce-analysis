# 📊 SQL + Python E-Commerce Data Analysis

This project performs **data analysis on an E-commerce dataset** using a combination of **SQL (SQLite)** for querying and **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.  

The goal is to uncover meaningful insights about **customer behavior, sales performance, payment methods, delivery timelines, and product categories**.

## 📑 Dataset
- Includes multiple CSVs: `customers.csv`, `orders.csv`, `order_items.csv`, `products.csv`, etc.  
- Due to GitHub size limits, only **sample CSV files** may be uploaded in `data/` for quick testing.  
- For full analysis, please download the dataset directly from Kaggle.
